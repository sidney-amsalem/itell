#### Pages

The textbook's contents are divided into Pages. You can access different Pages using the left-side navigation bar.

Below is an overview of a Page in iTELL.

<i-image src="/images/userguide/userguide_prolific_2.png">
  What each Page looks like.
</i-image>

1. The progress bar (in blue) shows how far you have scrolled down the page.
2. The left hand navigation bar will have links to different Chapters and Sections within the Module. Pages with checkmarks mean that you have completed those pages. Pages with locks mean that you have to complete the preceding page to unlock those pages.
3. Click on the "Reset page" link to reset page progress in case you are stuck.
4. Click on the "Write summary" link to move to the bottom of the page where the Summary-writing activity is located.
5. Click on the "Back to top" link to move to the top of the page.
6. The right hand navigation bar contains links to subsections within the current page.
7. iTELL AI is a conversational agent that is available to discuss the page that you are currently reading. To interact with iTELL AI, click on the chat box in the bottom right of your screen.

#### Making Progress

Most iTELL pages will have one more short answer questions and a single summary writing activity at the end of the page. You will not be able to proceed to the next page without successfully completing all tasks on your current page.

##### 1 Read

Most of the content in a page will be blurred at the beginning. As you read through the page, click on the red button that reads "Click here to continue reading" to unblur the next section and continue reading.

&nbsp;

##### 2 Answer Questions

Sometimes you will see "Click here to see question" button. After clicking the button, you will provide a brief explanation of a concept to demonstrate your understanding of the text that you have read.

<Image src="/images/userguide/userguide_prolific_3.png">
  You will need to answer the constructed response item first to unblur the next section

<Image src="/images/userguide/userguide_prolific_4.png">
  Submitting the correct answer to the constructed response item will unlock the next section
</Image>

<Image src="/images/userguide/userguide_prolific_5.png">
  After submitting an incorrect answer, you can try to revise your answer and resubmit by clicking on the "Resubmit" button. You can also click on the "Reveal Answer" button to reveal the correct answer, or click on the "How can I improve my answer?" button to receive a more detailed feedback. You can also choose to skip the question by clicking on "Skip this question".

&nbsp;

##### 3 Write a Summary

A summary writing activity is located at the bottom of each page. After you answer all short answer questions on the current page, you will be asked to summarize the contents of the page before you can move on to the next page. Write a summary and submit it to receive feedback.

<Image src="/images/userguide/userguide_summary.png">
  The summary feature is disabled until you finish reading the whole page and answer all constructed response items on the page.
</Image>

###### Evaluation

Your summary will be evaluated according to four metrics:

Content: Whether your summary shows good coverage of the page's main points and provides details to support those points.
Language: Whether your summary shows effective and varied use of sentence structures and vocabulary.
Language Borrowing: Whether you have written the summary in your own words or borrowed language from the text.
Relevance: Whether the topics and ideas discussed in your summary are sufficiently relevant to the content of the page.

###### Feedback

If your summary fails to pass the evaluation, you will be given additional attempts to revise and resubmit your summary. Click on the _Details_ tab to access more detailed feedback to help you write a better summary.

<Image src="/images/userguide/userguide9.png">
  Summaries that do not receive a passing grade will be given detailed feedback.

&nbsp;

###### Re-reading

If your summary fails to pass the evaluation, iTELL's conversational agent (iTELL AI) will analyze your summary and redirect you to a part of the textbook that you could re-read to write a better summary. Read more about this process below in the iTELL AI section.

###### Notes

- Your past summaries will be accessible from your dashboard.

#### Assisted Re-reading

If you submit a summary that does not pass the evaluation, iTELL AI will automatically redirect you to a part of the textbook that you should re-read to improve your understanding of the reading material and to write a better summary.

Make sure to spend enough time re-reading the highlighted text. Click on the `I'm ready for question` button when you are ready to answer a question about the passage.

<Image src="/images/userguide/userguide_iTELLAI_3.png">
  iTELL AI will ask you a question about the highlighted passage.
</Image>

Answer the question and engage in a conversation with iTELL AI to gain a better understanding of the passage. Once you feel that you have a better understanding of the text, click on the `Return to summary` button to go back to the summary module and rewrite your summary. After responding to iTELL AI's question, you can continue to engage with iTELL AI, or go back to the summary module

iTELL AI will only automatically redirect you for re-reading one time per page. If you submit more summaries that fail the evaluation, you will have the choice to manually engage in this re-reading activity by clicking on the `See question` button. Please note that this button will only appear if you submit a **failing** summary.
